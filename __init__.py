Kokoro TTS - TensorFlow Keras Implementation

A neural text-to-speech system converted from PyTorch to TensorFlow Keras.
Uses TFAlbertModel instead of AlbertModel as requested.

Main components:
- KModelTF: Main TTS model with TFAlbert encoder
- KPipelineTF: Language-aware pipeline for text processing
- Custom layers for neural vocoding and synthesis

Note: This is a conversion from PyTorch with several conversion challenges:
1. Weight loading from PyTorch checkpoints requires manual mapping
2. Some layer behaviors differ between frameworks (normalization, padding, etc.)
3. G2P (grapheme-to-phoneme) libraries may need separate integration
4. STFT/iSTFT implementations use different underlying operations

# Conversion notes for users

IMPORTANT CONVERSION NOTES:

1. Model Weights:
   - PyTorch .pth files need manual conversion to TensorFlow format
   - Weight mapping between frameworks requires careful attention to layer naming
   
2. AlbertModel Replacement:
   - Successfully replaced with TFAlbertModel as requested
   - Behavior should be equivalent but may have minor numerical differences
   
3. Layer Differences:
   - Some normalization layers have different default behaviors
   - Padding modes may differ between frameworks
   - Conv1D parameter ordering differs (filters vs channels)
   
4. STFT Operations:
   - Custom STFT implementation converted but may have accuracy differences
   - TensorFlow tf.signal.stft provides alternative but different windowing
   
5. G2P Integration:
   - Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion needs language-specific library integration
   - Current implementation uses placeholder functions
   
6. Training Compatibility:
   - Model architecture converted but training loop would need TensorFlow implementation
   - Loss functions and optimizers need separate conversion
   
7. Performance:
   - Memory usage patterns may differ between frameworks
   - GPU utilization characteristics may vary
   
For production use, thorough testing and validation against PyTorch outputs is recommended.
